<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>For my project, I will be utilizing the NewsData API to retrieve news<br>data and incorporate it into my application. The NewsData API provides access to<br>a vast collection of news articles from various sources and categories. The data<br>I plan to use from the NewsData API includes the following key information:<div><ul><li><b>Headline</b>:<br>The title or headline of the news article.</li><li><b>Description</b>: A brief summary or description<br>of the news article.</li><li><b>Source</b>: The publication or source from which the news article<br>originates.</li><li><b>Publication Date</b>: The date when the news article was published.</li><li><b>Category</b>: The category or<br>topic to which the news article belongs (e.g., sports, entertainment, world).</li></ul><div>My project will<br>leverage this data in several ways to provide a comprehensive news experience for<br>users. The route I intend to invoke for this information would be &quot;&lt;span<br>style=&quot;background-color: initial; color: rgb(168, 255, 96); font-family: Inconsolata, Monaco, Consolas, &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier,<br>monospace; font-size: 1em; word-spacing: normal; white-space: pre;&quot;&gt;<a href="https://newsdata2.p.rapidapi.com/news">https://newsdata2.p.rapidapi.com/news</a></span>&quot;. Here&#39;s how I plan to use<br>the data:</div></div><div><br></div><div><ol><li><b>Displaying News Feed</b>: I will fetch the latest news articles from the<br>API and present them in a news feed format. The feed will include<br>the headline, description, source, and publication date for each article. This will enable<br>users to stay updated with the most recent news across various categories.</li><li><b>Search Functionality</b>:<br>Users will be able to search for specific news articles based on keywords<br>or phrases. I will utilize the API&#39;s search capabilities to fetch relevant articles<br>or phrases. The search results will be displayed with relevant details, such as<br>headline, source, and publication date.</li><li><b>Filtering by Category</b>: To enhance user experience, I will<br>incorporate the ability to filter news articles by category. Users will have the<br>option to select specific categories of interest, such as sports, entertainment, or world.<br>The application will retrieve and display news articles exclusively from the chosen category.</li><li><b>Detailed<br>News View</b>: When a user selects a specific news article from the feed<br>or search results, the application will retrieve the complete content of the article<br>from the API. This will enable users to read the full news article<br>within the application, including all relevant details such as the headline, source, publication<br>date, and content.</li></ol></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> API Info</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The chosen API for my project is the NewsData API. Here are some<br>important details regarding the API:<div><br></div><div>1.&nbsp;<b>Quota and Refresh Frequency</b>:<div><ul><li><b>Quota</b>: The API provides a daily<br>quota of 200 API credits.</li><li><b>Refresh Frequency</b>: The quote refreshes on a daily basis.</li></ul><div>2.<br><b>Limits and Considerations</b>:</div></div></div><div><ul><li><b>Credits per Request</b>: With each API request, I can fetch up<br>to 10 articles per credit. This limitation should be taken into account when<br>designing the functionality of my application.</li><li><b>Support</b>: The API offers basic support, so I<br>would be referring to the API documentation for guidance and troubleshooting.</li><li><b>Uptime SLA</b>: The<br>API guarantees a 99.99% uptime Service Level Agreement (SLA), ensuring a reliable and<br>consistent service.</li><li><b>CORS Enabled</b>: The API allows Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for localhost, which<br>means I can make API requests directly from my local development environment.</li><li><b>Realtime News</b>:<br>The API provides real-time article availability, which can be utilized to fetch the<br>most up-to-date news articles.</li></ul></div><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> General Prompts (see checklist, copy/paste the prompts into the submission)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>In the past, I have worked on consuming APIs, although it has been<br>a while since I last did so, and I may need to refresh<br>my knowledge and skills in that area. While I have experience using APIs,<br>I have not created my own API before. As for alternative API choices,<br>one that comes to mind is the Spotify API. This API provides access<br>to various music-related data and features, such as retrieving playlists, searching for tracks,<br>and managing user libraries. The Spotify API would be a potential option for<br>integrating Spotify&#39;s music catalog and functionality into my project. The API can be<br>accessed via the link &quot;<a href="https://rapidapi.com/Glavier/api/spotify23">https://rapidapi.com/Glavier/api/spotify23</a>&quot;.<br></p><br></td></tr>
