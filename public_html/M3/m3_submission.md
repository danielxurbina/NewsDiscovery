    2. **Important**: The function that drives one of the challenges is `updateCurrentPage(str)` which takes 1 parameter, a string of the word to display as the current page. This function is not included in the code of the page, along with a few other things, are linked via an external js file. Make sure you do not delete this line.  
5. Create a branch called M3-Challenge-HW if you haven't yet
6. Add this template to that branch (git add/git commit)
7. Make a pull request for this branch once you push it
8. You may manually deploy the HW branch to dev to get the evidence for the below prompts
9. Create a new file **m3_submission.md** file in the hw branch and fill it with the output generated from this page (be careful not to paste more than once)
10. Add, commit, and push the submission file

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Briefly explain how you made the navigation horizontal</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>To achieve a horizontal navigation layout, I opted for the &lt;nav&gt; element and<br>its child tags, namely &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt;. To style it using CSS, I<br>utilized the "display" property, specifically setting it to "inline-block". This particular setting enables<br>each list item to function as an inline element, offering the flexibility to<br>define customized dimensions, margins, and padding as required. Moreover, I eliminated any default<br>padding or margin applied to both the list items and the unordered list,<br>ensuring that there is no unnecessary spacing between the navigation links. I accomplished<br>this by setting the margin and padding values to zero.</p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how you remove the navigation list item markers</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>In order to remove the navigation list item markers, I used the CSS<br>property list-style-type&nbsp;and assigned it a value of <code style="">none</code>. I specifically targeted the<br>&lt;nav&gt;&nbsp;tag and its child &lt;ul&gt;&nbsp;tag, and placed the CSS code within the corresponding<br>brackets.</p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Briefly explain how you gave the navigation a background</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>To give the navigation a background, I targeted the &lt;nav&gt; tag and applied<br>the CSS property background-color to set the color to dark grey.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Briefly explain how you made the links (or their surrounding area) change color on mouseover/hover</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>To enable color changes in the links or their surrounding area upon mouseover,<br>I targeted the &lt;a&gt; tag, which was nested within the &lt;nav&gt; tag. I<br>opted for the &lt;a&gt; tag because it allowed me to individually target each<br>link, including its margin. Alongside this, I employed the hover pseudo-class (a:hover) to<br>achieve the desired hovering effect on the tag. Finally, I utilized the CSS<br>property background-color to modify the background color of the respective tag.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 5: </em> Briefly explain how you changed the challenge list bullet points to checkmarks (âœ“)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>To convert the bullet points in the challenge list to checkmarks, I focused<br>on the &lt;li&gt; tag within the &lt;ul&gt; tag and modified the list style<br>to display checkmark characters. Although I couldn't find a built-in list style with<br>checkmarks, I decided to use a checkmark string to achieve the desired outcome.</p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 6: </em> Briefly explain how you made the first character of the h1 tags and anchor tags uppercased</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>To capitalize the first character of the &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;a&gt; tags, I targeted<br>both elements and utilized the CSS property &quot;text-transform&quot; by setting it to &quot;capitalize&quot;.<br>This approach effectively achieved the desired outcome.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 7: </em> Briefly explain/describe your custom styling of your choice</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>My personal preference for custom styling involves targeting the &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, and<br>&lt;a&gt; tags and utilizing four CSS properties: display, color, text-decoration, and padding. In<br>terms of display, I set it to &quot;block&quot; to ensure that it appears<br>as a block element with spacing around it, enabling me to adjust the<br>width and height of the block. Specifically, I applied this to the &lt;a&gt;<br>tags which correspond to the individual links within the navigation bar. To achieve<br>a desired aesthetic, I chose the color property and set it to &quot;white,&quot;<br>thereby altering the text color accordingly. Additionally, I utilized the text-decoration property and<br>set it to &quot;none&quot; to eliminate any decorative elements for the text. Lastly,<br>I employed the padding property to control the thickness of the box, enabling<br>me to customize the spacing of the links within the navigation bar and<br>ultimately influence the overall presentation of the bar.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 8: </em> Briefly explain how the styling for the challenge list doesn't impact the navigation list</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The reason why the styling for the challenge list does not affect the<br>navigation list is because I initially targeted the nav tag when styling the<br>navigation list. The nav tag serves as the parent tag for all the<br>other tags such as &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, and &lt;a&gt;. On the other hand, when<br>styling the challenge list, the parent tag is &lt;ul&gt;. Therefore, by targeting &lt;ul&gt;<br>instead of nav, only the &lt;ul&gt; tag is affected.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 9: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the h1 tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>To update the content of the &lt;h1&gt; tag with the link text, I<br>utilized a query selector on the document to select all of the &lt;a&gt;<br>tags in the navigation bar. I assigned this selection to a variable called<br>navOptions. Then, I initialized another variable called currentSelection and set it to an<br>empty string, which would later store the text of the currently pressed link.</p><br><p>Next,<br>I employed a forEach loop on navOptions and added a click event listener<br>to capture the click target and retrieve its inner text. Once I obtained<br>the inner text of the target, I assigned it to the currentSelection variable<br>that was set earlier.</p><br><p>After obtaining the link text, I used a query selector<br>to target the &lt;h1&gt; tag and updated its inner text with the link<br>text.</p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 10: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the title tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>To update the content of the &lt;tittle&gt; tag with the link text, I<br>utilized a query selector on the document to select all of the &lt;a&gt;<br>tags in the navigation bar.

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>What I learned the most were event listeners and how to effectively utilize<br>them. Initially, I struggled to comprehend the precise way of capturing the click<br>target. However, through thorough documentation review, I gained a comprehensive understanding of how<br>to apply the click event listener to achieve the desired outcome. Additionally, I<br>acquired knowledge about CSS styling, particularly in relation to padding and display properties,<br>and the myriad possibilities they offer, along with their associated nuances.<br></p><br></td></tr>
