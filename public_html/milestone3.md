<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>To associate API data with users, my application will utilize the &quot;<b>UserNewsInteractions</b>&quot; table.<br>This table will be responsible for storing user interactions with news articles, such<br>as marking articles as favorites, leaving comments, providing feedback, and rating articles. When<br>a user interacts with a news article, the application will register the interaction<br>type as a string, allowing for easy filtering on the client-side when fetching<br>data from the database.<div><br></div><div>In the &quot;<b>UserNewsInteractions</b>&quot; table, I have included the following additional<br>columns to store relevant details about the user&#39;s interactions with news articles:</div><div><ul><li><b>interaction_details</b>: This<br>column will store additional information related to the user&#39;s interaction with the news<br>article. For instance, if a user likes a news article, this data can<br>be stored in this column as a string &quot;like&quot;.</li><li><b>interaction_rating</b>: If applicable, this column<br>will enable users to rate articles they interact with using a thumbs up/down<br>button or a rating system. Haven&#39;t implemented this into the project yet as<br>I didn&#39;t have the time to implement a star rating system, but in<br>the future this column will be used.</li><li><b>interaction_timestamp</b>: This column will store the exact<br>timestamp when the user&#39;s interaction with a news article occurred.</li></ul><div>With this design, I<br>can effectively associate API data with individual users and provide a personalized and<br>dynamic user experience based on their interactions with news articles.</div></div><br></p><br></td></tr>

Username<br>Filter: The script checks if the &quot;filterUsername&quot; POST parameter is set. If it<br>is, the script fetches the user ID based on the username and updates<br>the &quot;$userNewsInteractions&quot; array with the liked articles associated with that user.<br>5. Article Limit<br>Filter: If the &quot;articleLimit&quot; POST parameter is set, the script updates the &quot;article_limit&quot;<br>variable and fetches the corresponding articles and users based on the new limit.<br>6.<br>Unlike Button Handling: If the &quot;unlikeButton&quot; POST parameter is set, the script removes<br>all likes for a specific article and displays a success flash message.<br>7. Delete<br>Button Handling: If the &quot;delete&quot; POST parameter is set, the script removes all<br>liked articles for a specific user and displays a success flash message.<br>8. Data<br>Processing: The script loops through the &quot;userNewsInteractions&quot; array to extract user IDs and<br>news IDs for further data processing. It then retrieves the articles and users<br>based on the specified article limit and stores them in the respective arrays.<br>9.<br>Likes Count: The script counts the number of likes for each article and<br>updates the &quot;articleLikesCount&quot; array accordingly.<br></p>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>articles_liked_by_users.php - This code section is responsible for rendering the user-liked articles in<br>a table format. Here&#39;s a breakdown of the functionality:<br><br>1. Delete Form (Conditional): If<br>the &quot;filter_applied&quot; session variable is set, the code displays a form to remove<br>all liked articles associated with a specific user. The form includes a hidden<br>input field to pass the username and a button to initiate the removal<br>process.<br>2. Article Table: The code generates an HTML table to display the list<br>of user-liked articles. The table includes columns for the article&#39;s ID, title, number<br>of likes, buttons to read more and unlike, and a column for displaying<br>usernames of users who liked each article.<br>3. Table Caption: The table begins with<br>a caption that shows the total number of articles being liked by users,<br>obtained by counting the articles in the &quot;$articles&quot; array.<br>4. Table Header: The table<br>header is styled with a dark background and includes column headers such as<br># (for the row number), Article ID, Title, Likes (number of likes), View<br>Article (button), Unlike (button), and Usernames.<br>5. Table Body (Loop): The code iterates through<br>the &quot;$articles&quot; array and generates a table row for each article. The row<br>displays the article&#39;s ID, title, number of likes (obtained from the &quot;$articleLikesCount&quot; array),<br>buttons to read more and unlike (remove the like association), and usernames of<br>users who liked the article.<br>6. Unlike Button Handling: The unlike button is enclosed<br>in a form, and when clicked, it triggers a POST request with the<br>article ID. The script will then remove all likes for that specific article,<br>providing a seamless user experience.<br>7. Usernames: For each article, the code retrieves the<br>usernames of users who liked the article by iterating through the &quot;$userNewsInteractions&quot; array<br>and matching the news IDs with the article&#39;s ID. It then displays the<br>usernames as links that redirect to the respective user profiles.<br><br><br></p>

The $userNewsInteractions variable is assigned the result<br>of the function get_all_user_liked_articles(), which retrieves all the articles liked by users. The<br>function returns an array of user-news interaction records, where each record contains the<br>news_id representing the articles liked.<br>3.

The variable $isSearched is set to true to indicate<br>that a search has been performed.<br>7. If the article limit is provided ($_POST[&#39;articleLimit&#39;]),<br>the code updates the $article_limit variable accordingly and fetches articles with no likes<br>based on the provided limit.

Here&#39;s an explanation of the code:<br><br>1. The code<br>begins with a container-fluid element to structure the content of the page.<br>2. There&#39;s<br>a heading &quot;Assign Likes to Articles&quot; displayed on the page.<br>3. The first form<br>with the id &quot;filterForm&quot; contains two search input fields for article title and<br>username, along with a &quot;Search&quot; button to submit the form and filter the<br>articles accordingly.<br>4. The second form with the id &quot;applyLikes&quot; contains a &quot;Assign Likes&quot;<br>button, which allows administrators to apply the selected likes to the articles once<br>they have made their choices.<br>5. The page is divided into two columns using<br>Bootstrap grid classes: the left column displays a table of articles, while the<br>right column displays a table of users.<br>6. The left column&#39;s table presents a<br>list of articles with their IDs, titles, and the usernames of users who<br>liked each article. Each article entry has a checkbox, allowing administrators to select<br>articles they wish to assign likes to.<br>7. The right column&#39;s table lists all<br>the users with their IDs and usernames. Each user entry also has a<br>checkbox to select users who will receive the likes for the chosen articles.<br>8.<br>The page provides JavaScript functions like &quot;toggleCheckbox&quot; and &quot;toggleUserCheckbox&quot; to manage the checkboxes&#39;<br>behavior when selected or deselected.<br>9. The tables have captions displaying the total number<br>of articles and users being displayed, which updates dynamically based on the search<br>filters and selected checkboxes.<br></p>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Throughout the development process, my most significant challenge was implementing the &quot;articles_liked_by_users.php&quot; page.<br>The main issue arose when trying to list user likes in the table<br>for the administrator section. Retrieving data from the <code>&lt;b&gt;UserNewsInteractions&lt;/b&gt;</code>&nbsp;table was complex since it<br>only held news IDs and user IDs. To display meaningful information, I had<br>to perform several steps: first, get all user news interactions from the table,<br>then extract the corresponding news IDs and user IDs from the result. Next,<br>I used these IDs to fetch article information using <code>&lt;b&gt;get_articles()</code></b>&nbsp;and user details using<br><code>&lt;b&gt;get_multiple_user_infos()&lt;/b&gt;</code>. Additionally, I needed to cross-check user IDs to verify the correctness of<br>associations, which involved considerable data handling.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>To overcome this challenge, I adopted a step-by-step<br>approach. I focused on validating the flow of data from <code>&lt;b&gt;UserNewsInteractions&lt;/b&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;b&gt;get_articles()&lt;/b&gt;</code><br>and <code>&lt;b&gt;get_multiple_user_infos()&lt;/b&gt;</code>, ensuring each step provided the correct information. I also used debugging<br>techniques to inspect the data at different stages and identify any potential errors.<br>By breaking down the problem into smaller tasks and resolving them incrementally, I<br>successfully displayed user likes in the table, facilitating administrators understanding of user preferences.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>
